# Project Status — open blockers and tracked follow-ups

Last updated: 2026-08-26 (SMTP / email-sending service sprint)

## About this file

This file records work that is **blocked on something outside the codebase** —
an AWS console change, a vendor contract, a credential only Joe can provision —
so that a blocked item is tracked in one place instead of living in a code
comment that the next sprint deletes.

**A note on this file's own history, since it matters for how much to trust
older references to it:** several earlier sprints
(`verify_litellmreloadaction.py`, `verify_portfolioc.py`, `verify_portfolioux1.py`,
`verify_superadminmenu.py`) state that a follow-up was "recorded as a tracked
follow-up in docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md". **The file did not exist** — it was never
committed and git shows no deletion. Those sprints' follow-ups are therefore
*not* recorded here yet and have not been back-filled by this sprint. If you are
looking for one of them, it is in that sprint's verify script and log, not here.
This file starts with the email item below.

## 1. Email sending (invites) — BLOCKED on two AWS-side actions

**Status: built, wired, verified — and NOT working end-to-end.** Real delivery
is blocked on AWS-account changes that cannot be made from this codebase.

### What now exists in the code (done, verified)

Before this sprint there was **no email-sending code anywhere in the API** — no
SES, SMTP, SendGrid, Postmark or Resend client in `services/` or `routers/`.
That blocked an already-shipped feature: `POST /admin/invites` mints a real
invite and returns an `enrollment_url` for the admin to share **by hand**,
because there was no way to mail it.

Now shipped:

- `apps/api/services/email.py` — the single AWS SES choke point. Credential gate
  (`credential_state()` / `probe()`, following the `portfolio_altruist.py`
  pattern), one `send_email()` that returns SES's own `MessageId`, and an error
  taxonomy that classifies a failure as `credentials` / `iam` /
  `identity_or_sandbox` / `paused` / `transport`.
- `render_invite_email()` — a plain-text + minimal-HTML invite carrying the
  **inviting org's own** name, that org's `enrollment_url`, and the expiry
  derived from that org's configurable `invite.expiry_days` setting.
- `services/invites.py` — `create_invite()` now attempts a real send and records
  the outcome in `result["email_delivery"]` on **every** path.
- `routers/invites.py` — the create response returns `email_delivery`, and
  `GET /admin/email/status` re-probes SES live so the AWS actions below can be
  confirmed done without a redeploy.

**The fallback is announced, not silent.** When a send cannot happen the invite
still succeeds and `enrollment_url` is still returned — but `email_delivery`
carries `status: "blocked"`, `manual_share_required: true`, and a reason naming
the exact AWS action to take. Returning the URL as though mail had gone out is
the failure mode this sprint exists to prevent.

### Why it does not work today (measured live, not assumed)

Verified against the credentials **Doppler** actually serves to Render, on
2026-08-26:

1. **The IAM permission does not exist.** The credentials are valid and live —
   `sts:GetCallerIdentity` resolves them — but they belong to
   `arn:aws:iam::645767464372:user/Texttrac-Ripasso`, the **Textract-only** IAM
   user. A real authorization probe on the send action returns:

   ```
   AccessDeniedException: User '…:user/Texttrac-Ripasso' is not authorized
   to perform 'ses:SendEmail'
   ```

   This is the **same gap as the earlier invite sprint**. Tonight's Doppler
   credential rotation restored *working keys*; it did not change *what those
   keys are allowed to do*. Rotating them again will not help.

2. **The SES sandbox state cannot even be read.** `ses:GetAccount`,
   `ses:GetAccountSendingEnabled` and `sesv2:ListEmailIdentities` are **all**
   denied for this principal, so this deployment cannot determine whether the
   AWS account is out of sandbox. The code reports that as *unknown* rather than
   guessing. This is an **independent second blocker**: a sandboxed SES account
   can only deliver to verified addresses, so granting `ses:SendEmail` alone
   could still cause invites to real prospective members to be rejected.

3. **No verified sender is configured.** Doppler holds `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` — and **no** `SES_*`
   variable at all. `SES_FROM_EMAIL` is unset.

### ACTION ITEMS — Joe, outside this sprint

| # | Action | Where |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | Attach an IAM policy granting `ses:SendEmail` and `ses:SendRawEmail` (and `ses:GetAccount` so the status endpoint can report sandbox state) to the principal the deployment uses — either to `Texttrac-Ripasso` or, preferably, to a **new dedicated IAM user for mail**, whose keys then replace `AWS_*` in Doppler. | AWS IAM console |
| 2 | Verify a sender identity in SES — the address or, better, the sending domain (DKIM). | AWS SES console, `us-east-1` |
| 3 | **Request SES production access** (exit sandbox) for this account/region. Until this is done, delivery is restricted to verified addresses and real member invites will fail. | AWS SES console → Account dashboard |
| 4 | Set `SES_FROM_EMAIL` (and optionally `SES_FROM_NAME`, `SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`) in Doppler; confirm they reach Render. | Doppler |

**To confirm when done:** call `GET /admin/email/status` as an admin. It makes
one real SES call and reports `ok`, the gap, and `sandbox_known` /
`production_access`. Or re-run `apps/api/scripts/verify_smtpservice.py`, which
exits non-zero while this is blocked and will attempt a real send — and assert a
real `MessageId` — the moment the gate reports usable.

### Verification result (2026-08-26)

`apps/api/scripts/verify_smtpservice.py` → **9 PASS, 0 FAIL, 1 BLOCKED**, exit 2.

Everything that can be verified is: the discovery findings, the loud-failure
messages (including a **real** refused SES call proving the IAM message names
`ses:SendEmail`), the announced manual-URL fallback, cross-org content
correctness, output safety, and zero-leftover teardown. The single BLOCKED line
is real delivery, per the action items above. It is deliberately *not* reported
as a pass: "we correctly reported that we cannot send email" is not "email
works".

### One real bug this sprint found and fixed

`DEFAULT_SETTINGS["brand.name"]` is the literal string `"2nd Act Capital"`, and
**Hollisworks has no `brand.name` row**. Resolving the sender name with the
ordinary `get_setting()` would therefore have signed **every Hollisworks invite
email with 2nd Act Capital's name**. `resolve_org_display_name()` uses
`get_setting_with_origin()` instead and falls back to `organizations.name` (which
is per-org and `NOT NULL`), so the platform default is unreachable on this path.

This is the same "silently inherit the other tenant's value" shape as the Auth0
`domain ?? AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `appBaseUrl ?? APP_BASE_URL` and `audience` bugs — and
worse here, because the recipient sees it.

## 2. Notes for whoever runs the verify scripts

Working database credentials live in **Doppler**. The copies in `apps/api/.env`
and `~/.bashrc` are **stale** and their passwords are rejected by Postgres for
both the `postgres` and `app_service` roles; that stale copy is what produced
several sprints of false "blocked on credentials" results.

`apps/api/scripts/_doppler_env.py` hydrates `os.environ` from Doppler over its
**HTTPS API** using `DOPPLER_TOKEN` (stdlib only, no CLI, never prints a value).
`verify_smtpservice.py` uses it and overwrites the ambient values deliberately —
deferring to what is already set would preserve exactly the stale-copy bug.
